Hippie hybrid nerd. I enjoy programming, aerial performing, and traveling (especially the outdoors).
I first began my self taught journey in software development ~4 years ago.
The foundation of my semantic knowledge follows the thought patterns associated with SICP, Scheme and Clojure.
As a result, my personal coding style leans functional- I've learned that abstraction is the key to elegant and maintainable code.
I also understand one of the most important skills to leverage as an engineer is the ability to select the right tool for the job.
Python has provided a wonderful landscape to hone my back-end expertise while implementing professional conventions.
I hope you enjoy my blog!
